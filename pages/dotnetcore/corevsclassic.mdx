## How does ASP.NET Core differ from previous versions of ASP.NET? (With example)
ASP.NET Core differs significantly from previous versions of ASP.NET in various key aspects, including architecture, performance, platform support, and development practices. Here's a detailed comparison of **ASP.NET Core** versus **ASP.NET (previous versions)**, with examples to illustrate the differences:

### 1. **Cross-Platform Support**

**ASP.NET Core**:
- ASP.NET Core is **cross-platform** and can run on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. This is achieved through the **.NET Core runtime**, allowing developers to deploy applications across different operating systems.
  
**ASP.NET (Old Versions)**:
- Traditional ASP.NET is **Windows-only** and is tied to the **.NET Framework**, which can only run on Windows servers and environments like IIS.

**Example**:
In **ASP.NET Core**, you can develop and deploy your application on Linux using a **Kestrel web server** and host it in a containerized environment like **Docker**.

```bash
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0
```

In contrast, ASP.NET on the .NET Framework would require an IIS-based hosting environment, limiting platform choices.

### 2. **Modular and Lightweight**

**ASP.NET Core**:
- ASP.NET Core is **modular** and allows you to include only the necessary libraries using **NuGet packages**. This results in a more lightweight and optimized application.

**ASP.NET (Old Versions)**:
- Traditional ASP.NET comes with a **monolithic** framework. It includes all components by default, even if you're not using them, leading to more overhead and slower performance.

**Example**:
In ASP.NET Core, you can explicitly configure only the middleware you need. For example, to serve static files:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseStaticFiles(); // Enable static file serving
}
```

In older ASP.NET versions, static file handling and other services are baked into the framework and automatically included, even if not needed.

### 3. **Performance**

**ASP.NET Core**:
- ASP.NET Core is **highly optimized for performance**. It uses the **Kestrel web server**, which is fast and lightweight. ASP.NET Core applications perform better due to optimizations in request processing, garbage collection, and asynchronous programming.

**ASP.NET (Old Versions)**:
- Traditional ASP.NET is slower compared to Core due to its dependency on IIS and a heavier request-processing pipeline.

**Example**:
ASP.NET Core can handle millions of requests per second when optimized for high performance, while older ASP.NET applications often struggle with high traffic.

### 4. **Unified Development Approach**

**ASP.NET Core**:
- In ASP.NET Core, you can build **web applications**, **APIs**, **microservices**, and **real-time applications** (using SignalR) within the same unified framework. It eliminates the need for separate frameworks like **Web API** or **MVC**, which existed in older ASP.NET.

**ASP.NET (Old Versions)**:
- Previous versions of ASP.NET used separate frameworks for different purposes. For example, **ASP.NET MVC** for web applications and **ASP.NET Web API** for APIs.

**Example**:
In **ASP.NET Core**, you can define both MVC controllers and Web API controllers in the same project:
```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetAllProducts()
    {
        return Ok(/* return product list */);
    }
}
```

In older ASP.NET, you'd use **ASP.NET MVC** for HTML page rendering and **ASP.NET Web API** for RESTful APIs, requiring separate setups.

### 5. **Middleware Pipeline**

**ASP.NET Core**:
- ASP.NET Core introduces a **middleware-based request pipeline**, where you control how each request is processed by adding or removing middleware components. This gives developers full control over the application's behavior and improves performance by minimizing unnecessary processing.

**ASP.NET (Old Versions)**:
- Previous versions of ASP.NET had a fixed pipeline, where the developer had less control over the order and type of components in the pipeline.

**Example**:
In ASP.NET Core, the middleware is explicitly configured:
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseRouting(); // Handles route processing
    app.UseAuthentication(); // Handles user authentication
    app.UseAuthorization(); // Handles role-based authorization
}
```

In older ASP.NET, you could only hook into specific lifecycle events (like `Application_BeginRequest`) in the **Global.asax** file, limiting customization.

### 6. **Dependency Injection (DI) Built-in**

**ASP.NET Core**:
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** is a first-class citizen in ASP.NET Core and is integrated throughout the framework, promoting loose coupling and testability.

**ASP.NET (Old Versions)**:
- In traditional ASP.NET, DI was not built-in. You had to rely on third-party libraries like **Unity**, **Autofac**, or **Ninject** to implement DI.

**Example**:
In ASP.NET Core, you can easily configure services in the `Startup.cs` file:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
}
```

In older ASP.NET, you'd have to manually set up DI through a third-party library and manage the lifecycle of objects.

### 7. **Configuration and Environment Handling**

**ASP.NET Core**:
- Configuration in ASP.NET Core is **modern and flexible**, using **JSON, XML, or environment variables**. It supports multiple environments (Development, Staging, Production), allowing you to load different configurations based on the current environment.

**ASP.NET (Old Versions)**:
- In traditional ASP.NET, configuration was handled mostly via **Web.config** XML files, which could become complex and difficult to manage.

**Example**:
In **ASP.NET Core**, environment-specific configuration is done via `appsettings.json` and environment variables:
```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=myServer;Database=myDB;User=myUser;Password=myPass;"
  }
}
```

In older ASP.NET, configurations were handled in **Web.config** using a verbose XML format.

### 8. **Open-Source and Community-Driven**

**ASP.NET Core**:
- ASP.NET Core is **open-source** and hosted on **GitHub**. It’s actively developed by both Microsoft and the open-source community. This encourages faster development cycles, bug fixes, and contributions from developers around the world.

**ASP.NET (Old Versions)**:
- Older ASP.NET was **closed-source** and developed solely by Microsoft, which limited community contributions and slowed down updates.
