### Basic GitHub Commands

Here are some of the most important and commonly used GitHub (Git) commands:


- **`git init`**: Initializes a new Git repository.
  ```
  git init
  ```

- **`git clone <repository-url>`**: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
  ```

- **`git status`**: Displays the state of the working directory and staging area.
  ```
  git status
  ```

- **`git add <file>`**: Stages changes to a specific file.
  ```
  git add filename.txt
  ```

- **`git commit -m "<message>"`**: Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
  ```
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

## Branching and Merging

- **`git branch`**: Lists all local branches in the repository.
  ```
  git branch
  ```

- **`git branch <branch-name>`**: Creates a new branch.
  ```
  git branch new-feature
  ```

- **`git checkout <branch-name>`**: Switches to the specified branch.
  ```
  git checkout new-feature
  ```

- **`git checkout -b <branch-name>`**: Creates and switches to a new branch.
  ```
  git checkout -b new-feature
  ```

- **`git merge <branch-name>`**: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
  ```
  git merge new-feature
  ```

## Remote Repository Commands

- **`git push origin <branch-name>`**: Pushes local changes to the remote repository.
  ```
  git push origin main
  ```

- **`git pull`**: Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository to the local repository.
  ```
  git pull origin main
  ```

- **`git remote add origin <url>`**: Adds a remote repository.
  ```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
  ```

## Inspection and Comparison

- **`git log`**: Shows the commit history.
  ```
  git log
  ```

- **`git diff`**: Displays changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
  ```
  git diff
  ```

- **`git show <commit>`**: Displays information about a specific commit.
  ```
  git show abc123
  ```

## Stashing Changes

- **`git stash`**: Temporarily saves changes in the working directory.
  ```
  git stash
  ```

- **`git stash pop`**: Applies the most recently stashed changes and removes them from the stash.
  ```
  git stash pop
  ```

These commands form the foundation of using Git effectively for version control in software development. Mastery of these commands will significantly enhance your workflow and collaboration with other developers[1][2][3][4][6].



### 1. **Set up Git for the first time:**
   - Configure your identity (required when committing for the first time):
     ```bash
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
     ```

### 2. **Initialize a Git repository:**
   - Initialize a new local repository:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

### 3. **Cloning a repository:**
   - Clone an existing repository from GitHub to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```

### 4. **Check the status of the repository:**
   - View the status of your current repository (staged, unstaged changes):
     ```bash
     git status
     ```

### 5. **Staging files:**
   - Stage a specific file for commit:
     ```bash
     git add <filename>
     ```
   - Stage all files for commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

### 6. **Commit changes:**
   - Commit staged changes with a message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Your commit message"
     ```

### 7. **View commit history:**
   - Check the history of commits in the current branch:
     ```bash
     git log
     ```

### 8. **Push changes to remote repository:**
   - Push your changes to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub):
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```

### 9. **Pull updates from remote repository:**
   - Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to your local repository:
     ```bash
     git pull
     ```

### 10. **Create and switch branches:**
   - Create a new branch:
     ```bash
     git branch <branch-name>
     ```
   - Switch to a different branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout <branch-name>
     ```

### 11. **Merge branches:**
   - Merge a branch into the current branch:
     ```bash
     git merge <branch-name>
     ```

### 12. **View branches:**
   - List all branches:
     ```bash
     git branch
     ```

### 13. **Delete a branch:**
   - Delete a branch locally:
     ```bash
     git branch -d <branch-name>
     ```

### 14. **Stash changes:**
   - Temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed:
     ```bash
     git stash
     ```
   - Apply stashed changes back to the working directory:
     ```bash
     git stash pop
     ```

### 15. **Reverting a commit:**
   - Revert a specific commit by commit hash:
     ```bash
     git revert <commit-hash>
     ```

These commands cover the essential tasks when working with Git and GitHub, helping you manage versions, collaborate on code, and maintain a clean project history.
