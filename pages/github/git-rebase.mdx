### What's git rebase?
### **What is Git Rebase?**

`git rebase` is a command that integrates changes from one branch into another in a **linear** history, unlike `git merge`, which results in a **non-linear** history. It is often used to keep a clean and readable project history by avoiding unnecessary merge commits.

### **How Does Git Rebase Work?**

When you use `git rebase`, Git moves or re-applies your commits **on top of another base commit**. This is often done by "rebasing" your feature branch onto the main branch to integrate the latest changes, but without creating a new merge commit.

### **Basic Rebase Workflow:**

#### 1. **Switch to the feature branch** (the one you want to rebase):
```bash
git checkout <feature-branch>
```

#### 2. **Rebase your feature branch onto the main branch:**
```bash
git rebase main
```

- This takes all the commits on your feature branch and re-applies them on top of the latest commit from the `main` branch.

#### 3. **Handle any conflicts** (if they arise):
- Git will pause rebasing if there are conflicts. Resolve the conflicts manually, then continue:
```bash
git add <resolved-file>
git rebase --continue
```

#### 4. **Push your rebased branch** (with the `--force` option):
- Since `git rebase` rewrites commit history, you may need to force push your branch:
```bash
git push --force
```

### **Advantages of Git Rebase:**

- **Clean History**: Rebasing avoids creating a merge commit, so the project history is linear and easier to read.
- **Better Collaboration**: When working on a feature branch, rebasing can ensure your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes without cluttering the history.

### **When to Use Git Rebase:**

- **Before merging** a feature branch into `main`, you can rebase it on top of the latest `main` commits to keep the history clean.
- **When collaborating**: If multiple people are working on the same project, rebasing can help avoid a tangled history.

### **When to Avoid Git Rebase:**

- **On shared branches**: If other developers are working on the same branch, rebasing can cause confusion because it rewrites commit history.
- **If you prefer a detailed history**: Merging shows the true sequence of events, whereas rebasing reorders commits to appear more linear.

### **Example:**

Let's say you have the following history:

```
A---B---C (main)
     \
      D---E (feature)
```

After running `git rebase main` on your `feature` branch, the history will look like this:

```
A---B---C---D'---E' (feature)
```

Now the commits from `feature` are "rebased" on top of `main`, and commits `D` and `E` become `D'` and `E'`, representing their new versions after rebasing.

### **Summary:**
- `git rebase` helps you reapply commits on top of a different base commit, giving you a linear and clean commit history.
- Itâ€™s useful for keeping branches up-to-date and avoiding unnecessary merge commits.
- Always avoid rebasing branches that are already shared with others to prevent issues.
