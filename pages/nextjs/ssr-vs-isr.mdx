**SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** and **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** are both strategies for rendering pages in Next.js, but they have key differences in when and how pages are generated and served.

Here's a detailed comparison between SSR and ISR:

---

### 🟢 **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

**SSR** generates the page **on every request**. When a user visits a page, Next.js fetches data, generates the HTML on the server, and sends it back to the client.

- **Rendering Time**: On-demand, at the time of the request.
- **Use Case**: When you need **up-to-date content** on every request, like for **dynamic data** that changes frequently (e.g., news websites, e-commerce product pages).
  
  - Next.js uses `getServerSideProps` to enable SSR.

#### Example of SSR:
```javascript
// pages/example.js
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}

const ExamplePage = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Server-Side Rendered Page</h1>
    <p>{data.info}</p>
  </div>
);

export default ExamplePage;
```

- 🕒 **Latency**: Longer since the page is generated for **every** request.
- 🔁 **Reusability**: No caching out of the box; data is fetched every time, leading to **more server load**.
- ⚙️ **SEO**: Good for SEO since HTML is delivered fully rendered.

### 🔵 **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**

**ISR** allows you to **statically generate** pages at build time, but with the ability to **regenerate them** on-demand in the background when a user visits, based on a specified **time interval**. This provides the benefit of static site generation (SSG) while keeping content up-to-date.

- **Rendering Time**: Pages are pre-generated at build time and **regenerated after a specified time** interval.
- **Use Case**: For pages that require **occasional updates** but don't need to be re-rendered on every request, such as **blogs, documentation, or content-heavy sites**.
  
  - Next.js uses `getStaticProps` with `revalidate` to enable ISR.

#### Example of ISR:
```javascript
// pages/example.js
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await res.json();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
    revalidate: 60, // Regenerate the page every 60 seconds
  };
}

const ExamplePage = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>Incrementally Static Regenerated Page</h1>
    <p>{data.info}</p>
  </div>
);

export default ExamplePage;
```

- 🕒 **Latency**: Very low after initial generation, since the content is cached as static HTML. Once regenerated, the next user gets the **fresh static version**.
- 🔄 **Reusability**: ISR caches the page for the duration of the `revalidate` interval. The next request within that interval gets the cached version.
- ⚙️ **SEO**: Excellent for SEO as the HTML is served statically but updated as necessary.

### 🔄 **Key Differences Between SSR and ISR**

| **Feature**              | **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**            | **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)**     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Page Generation Time**  | On every request                           | On demand, after initial static generation   |
| **Data Freshness**        | Always up-to-date (since it fetches per request) | Fresh after the `revalidate` interval       |
| **Speed of Serving Pages**| Slower (re-generated each time)            | Faster (serves pre-built static pages)       |
| **Server Load**           | Higher (rebuild on every request)          | Lower (regenerates in the background)        |
| **Use Case**              | Dynamic, constantly updating content       | Content that updates infrequently but needs to stay relatively fresh |
| **Example**               | News sites, e-commerce product pages       | Blogs, marketing pages, documentation        |
| **SEO**                   | Good for SEO                               | Excellent for SEO (since pages are static)   |
| **Caching**               | No automatic caching                       | Automatic caching, controlled by `revalidate` |
| **Next.js Methods Used**  | `getServerSideProps`                       | `getStaticProps` with `revalidate`           |

```

1. **SSR**: The page is rendered **each time** a user requests it, leading to **higher server load** but fresh data on every request.
2. **ISR**: The page is **pre-rendered once** at build time, and then periodically updated after a specified revalidation period, reducing server load and improving performance while maintaining freshness.

### Conclusion:

- Use **SSR** when you need to fetch data that **must be up-to-date** on every request (e.g., live data, frequently updated content).
- Use **ISR** when your content updates **infrequently** or has a **predictable update cycle**, as it allows you to **serve fast static pages** while still keeping content relatively fresh.
